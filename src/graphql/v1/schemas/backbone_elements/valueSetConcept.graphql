ValueSet.Concept
    A ValueSet resource instance specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more
    code systems, intended for use in a particular context. Value sets link
    between [[[CodeSystem]]] definitions and their use in [coded
    elements](terminologies.html).

    requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
