ValueSet
    A ValueSet resource instance specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more
    code systems, intended for use in a particular context. Value sets link
    between [[[CodeSystem]]] definitions and their use in [coded
    elements](terminologies.html).
    If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions
