DiagnosticReport
    The findings and interpretation of diagnostic  tests performed on patients,
    groups of patients, devices, and locations, and/or specimens derived from
    these. The report includes clinical context such as requesting and provider
    information, and some mix of atomic results, images, textual and coded
    interpretations, and formatted representation of diagnostic reports.
    If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions
