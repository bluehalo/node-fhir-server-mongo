CoverageEligibilityRequest
    The CoverageEligibilityRequest provides patient and insurance coverage
    information to an insurer for them to respond, in the form of an
    CoverageEligibilityResponse, with information regarding whether the stated
    coverage is valid and in-force and optionally to provide the insurance details
    of the policy.
    If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions
