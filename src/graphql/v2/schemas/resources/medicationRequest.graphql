MedicationRequest
    An order or request for both supply of the medication and the instructions for
    administration of the medication to a patient. The resource is called
    "MedicationRequest" rather than "MedicationPrescription" or "MedicationOrder"
    to generalize the use across inpatient and outpatient settings, including care
    plans, etc., and to harmonize with workflow patterns.
    If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions
