ImplementationGuide
    A set of rules of how a particular interoperability or standards problem is
    solved - typically through the use of FHIR resources. This resource is used to
    gather all the parts of an implementation guide into a logical whole and to
    publish a computable definition of all the parts.
    If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions
