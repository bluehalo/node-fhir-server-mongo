    Nucleic acids are defined by three distinct elements: the base, sugar and
    linkage. Individual substance/moiety IDs will be created for each of these
    elements. The nucleotide sequence will be always entered in the 5’-3’
    direction.
    If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions
