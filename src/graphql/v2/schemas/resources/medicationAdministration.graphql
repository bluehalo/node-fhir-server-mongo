MedicationAdministration
    Describes the event of a patient consuming or otherwise being administered a
    medication.  This may be as simple as swallowing a tablet or it may be a long
    running infusion.  Related resources tie this event to the authorizing
    prescription, and the specific encounter between patient and health care
    practitioner.
    If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions
