PlanDefinition
    This resource allows for the definition of various types of plans as a
    sharable, consumable, and executable artifact. The resource is general enough
    to support the description of a broad range of clinical artifacts such as
    clinical decision support rules, order sets and protocols.
    If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions
