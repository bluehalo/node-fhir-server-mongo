        Representation of the content produced in a DICOM imaging study. A study
    comprises a set of series, each of which includes a set of Service-Object Pair
    Instances (SOP Instances - images or other data) acquired or produced in a
    common context.  A series is of only one modality (e.g. X-ray, CT, MR,
    ultrasound), but a study may have multiple series of different modalities.
