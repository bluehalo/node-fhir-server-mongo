TriggerDefinition
    A description of a triggering event. Triggering events can be named events,
    data events, or periodic, as determined by the type element.
    If the element is present, it must have a value for at least one of the
    defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions

    May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
    definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
    there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
    extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
    requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
