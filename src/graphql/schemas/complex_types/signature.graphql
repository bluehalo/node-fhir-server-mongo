Signature
    A signature along with supporting context. The signature may be a digital
    signature that is cryptographic in nature, or some other signature acceptable
    to the domain. This other signature may be as simple as a graphical image
    representing a hand-written signature, or a signature ceremony Different
    signature approaches have different utilities.
    If the element is present, it must have a value for at least one of the
    defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions
