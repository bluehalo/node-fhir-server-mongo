Address
    An address expressed using postal conventions (as opposed to GPS or other
    location definition formats).  This data type may be used to convey addresses
    for use in delivering mail as well as for visiting locations which might not
    be valid for mail delivery.  There are a variety of postal address formats
    defined around the world.
    If the element is present, it must have a value for at least one of the
    defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions

    May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
    definition of the element. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable,
    there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and use of
    extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of
    requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
