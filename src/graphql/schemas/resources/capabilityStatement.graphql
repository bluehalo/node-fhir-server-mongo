CapabilityStatement
    A Capability Statement documents a set of capabilities (behaviors) of a FHIR
    Server for a particular version of FHIR that may be used as a statement of
    actual server functionality or a statement of required or desired server
    implementation.
    If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions
