    This element identifies another resource that can be used as a proxy of the
    security sensitivity to use when deciding and enforcing access control rules

    relationships to individuals, the referenced resource stands in as a proxy
    equivalent for this purpose. This referenced resource may be related to the
    Binary (e.g. Media, DocumentReference), or may be some non-related Resource
