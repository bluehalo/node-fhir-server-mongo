MessageHeader
    The header for a message exchange that is either requesting or responding to
    an action.  The reference(s) that are the subject of the action as well as
    other information related to the action are typically transmitted in a bundle
    in which the MessageHeader resource instance is the first resource in the
    bundle.
    If the element is present, it must have either a @value, an @id, or extensions
