Timing
    Specifies an event that may occur multiple times. Timing schedules are used to
    record when things are planned, expected or requested to occur. The most
    common usage is in dosage instructions for medications. They are also used
    when planning care of various kinds, and may be used for reporting the
    schedule to which past regular activities were carried out.
    If the element is present, it must have a value for at least one of the
    defined elements, an @id referenced from the Narrative, or extensions
