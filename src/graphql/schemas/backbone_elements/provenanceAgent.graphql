Provenance.Agent
    Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes
    involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource.
    Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling
    trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of
    contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own
    provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of
    confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and
    stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally
    authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust policies.
