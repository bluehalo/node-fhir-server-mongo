ResearchStudy.Arm
    A process where a researcher or organization plans and then executes a series
    of steps intended to increase the field of healthcare-related knowledge.  This
    includes studies of safety, efficacy, comparative effectiveness and other
    information about medications, devices, therapies and other interventional and
    investigative techniques.  A ResearchStudy involves the gathering of
    information about human or animal subjects.
