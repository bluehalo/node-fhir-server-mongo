# GraphQL Support in FHIR Server

This FHIR server implements support for querying FHIR data using GraphQL(https://graphql.org/).

### Playground
You can access the GraphQL playground by going to the /graphql url in your browser e.g., http://fhir.dev.bwell.zone/graphql.  This will redirect you to the OAuth provider to login and then will store your JWT token in a cookie so you can use the Playground.

### Making GraphQL calls to the server
You can use the standard GraphQL client libraries or Postman and access the /graphql url.  You will need to pass the OAuth token as a Bearer token to authenticate.  See https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server/blob/master/security.md for details.

### Documentation
All the GraphQL entities and properties have inline documentation from FHIR specifications

### Sample GraphQL query
```graphql
query {
  practitionerRole {
    id
    practitioner {
      name {
        family
        given
      }
    }
    organization {
      name
    }
    healthcareService {
      name
    }
    location {
      name
    }
  }
}
```
### Sample Python Code
```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://fhir.dev.bwell.zone/graphql"

payload="{\"query\":\"query {\\n  practitionerRole {\\n    id\\n    practitioner {\\n      name {\\n        family\\n        given\\n      }\\n    }\\n    organization {\\n      name\\n    }\\n    healthcareService {\\n      name\\n    }\\n    location {\\n      name\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\",\"variables\":{}}"
headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer {put token here}',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)

print(response.text)
```

### Sample Node.js code
```javascript
var https = require('follow-redirects').https;
var fs = require('fs');

var options = {
  'method': 'POST',
  'hostname': 'fhir.dev.bwell.zone',
  'path': '/graphql',
  'headers': {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer {put token here}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  'maxRedirects': 20
};

var req = https.request(options, function (res) {
  var chunks = [];

  res.on("data", function (chunk) {
    chunks.push(chunk);
  });

  res.on("end", function (chunk) {
    var body = Buffer.concat(chunks);
    console.log(body.toString());
  });

  res.on("error", function (error) {
    console.error(error);
  });
});

var postData = JSON.stringify({
  query: `query {
  practitionerRole {
    id
    practitioner {
      name {
        family
        given
      }
    }
    organization {
      name
    }
    healthcareService {
      name
    }
    location {
      name
    }
  }
}`,
  variables: {}
});

req.write(postData);

req.end();
```

### Sample cUrl Code
```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://fhir.dev.bwell.zone/graphql' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {put token here}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"query":"query {\n  practitionerRole {\n    id\n    practitioner {\n      name {\n        family\n        given\n      }\n    }\n    organization {\n      name\n    }\n    healthcareService {\n      name\n    }\n    location {\n      name\n    }\n  }\n}","variables":{}}'
```

### GraphQL Server Implementation
We use the apollo-server-express framework to implement the GraphQL middleware.  This is implemented in 
https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server/blob/master/src/middleware/graphqlServer.js

We use the graphql-tools framework, so we can store the schema and resolver for each FHIR entity in a separate file and then merge them together to create the full schema.

### Security
For security, we use the same mechanism for both REST and GraphQL.  There are two pieces to this:
1. The middleware to read auth tokens, decrypt them and add `request.user` and `request.scope`: https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server/blob/master/src/strategies/jwt.bearer.strategy.js
2. code to check these permissions when needed.  This code is stored in the https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server/tree/master/src/operations

### Code Generation
We use a code generator to read the FHIR schema and generate the GraphQL schema and resolvers.  This code generator is in https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server/blob/master/src/graphql/generator/generate_classes.py and can be run by typing the command `make graphql`.

In the https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server/tree/master/src/graphql/schemas folder each FHIR entity has its own GraphQL schema file.  The schema.graphql file is the top level schema element.
In the https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server/tree/master/src/graphql/resolvers folder each FHIR resource has its own GraphQL resolver file.  The resolvers.js merges all the resolvers together.

### FHIR References
This FHIR server automatically turns each reference into a nested access to the referenced resource.

### Adding reverse links
To add a reverse link:
1. Add a custom schema file (e.g., https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server/blob/master/src/graphql/schemas/custom/patient.graphql)
2. Add a custom resolver file (e.g., https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server/blob/master/src/graphql/resolvers/custom/patient.js)

The FHIR server will automatically load these the next time it runs.

### Adding Enrichment Providers
Sometimes you want to add enrichment to the underlying FHIR data (e.g., calculating totals, adding additional properties etc).  To enable this we have a concept of pluggable enrichment providers.

To add a new enrichment provider:
1. Add a new provider class here: https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server/tree/master/src/enrich/providers.  You can see examples in here.  Implement the interface.
2. Register your new provider in https://github.com/icanbwell/fhir-server/blob/98599cba3e10790e03e9e4f07e45b1c8f72818c1/src/enrich/enrich.js#L7
Now this enrichment provider will be run for every resource and can add additional properties.  These properties are available both when accessing the server via REST or GraphQL.
